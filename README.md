# About The Website Project

## The First Project High-Tech Blog

Explore my first simple website that has been created from scratch using the following tools: 
* `HTML` 
* `SCSS / CSS`
* `JavaScript`.

It is responsive with smartphone and tablet. It may not look perfect, but I did my best to make a web design adaptable to small screens.
It's been created in first and second semesters at college with excellent score.

## Getting Started

You can view my live website directly by clicking [Tech-Website](https://bolt-tech-web.netlify.app/) hosted by Netlify.

You can also study/modify and view the project locally. Continue and follow these simple steps to use this project.

## Prerequisites

* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (Compatible with Windows / Mac or Linux) and **must install two extensions:**
  * **[Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)** | To generate all `CSS` from `SCSS` in `Styles/` folder.
  * **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** | To host online

**Note:** My personal preference is Visual Studio Code, I'm sure there are other text editors with equivalent extensions/plugins that can be used with this project.

## Opening Bolt-Tech Website
To be able to see a live website, follow these steps:

1. When you open Visual Studio Code, click `File` on top left corner and click `Open Folder...` then navigate to your desired location where you cloned `tech-website` folder. **Or simply** right click on `tech-website` folder and click `Open with Code`.

1. Then click `Watch Sass` on bottom right to begin generating all `CSS`

1. Finally, on **Explorer** tab, right click on `index.html` then `Open with Live Server`. That's it, enjoy my project website.
