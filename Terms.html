           <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Bolt-Tech's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
           <ol type="i">
               <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
               <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>

               <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
               <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
           </ol>
            </li>
           <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Bolt-Tech at any time.
