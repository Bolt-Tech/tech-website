    <h1 class="about-title">About us</h1>
    <div class="Paragraph"><p>Bolt-Tech is a net famous search engine optimization company that has an amazing blog and an even more amazing set of products that help you get more traffic to your website. Their About Us page is one of the more robust examples in this list but instead of detracting from the message the extra content gives it a lot of authority.
The main focus of their About Page is a timeline graphic that takes you back through their history and details some achievements, challenges and major dates of the company. This gives a real sense of stability and gives you the idea that Moz will be around for a long time.
A major advantage of this type of About Page is that the timeline lets you feel part of their story. You know where you’re slotting in and you feel like it’s transparent.</p>
