      <p>With all of the excitement that's been boiling over for the past few days because of the Steam Summer Sale and
      all of its wondrous gaming discounts, it's easy to forget that Valve's digital distribution platform does offer
      a few pieces of select hardware too and like the games they help you play, they too are discounted.</p>

    <p class="text-middle">So what can you get on the cheap this Summer Sale season? </p>

    <p>First up is the Steam Controller. Valve's take on the contemporary gamepad with added touch sensors, a single
      joystick and all of the face buttons and triggers that you could possibly want. They are a little on the
      plasticky side and that lack of a second joystick can make certain games a little difficult to play with it --
      at the very least they have a new learning curve -- but for the most part it's a decent controller and you can
      now pick it up for &#8362; 120 through Steam. </p>

    <p>It's also available with a bunch of different games at various discounts too. </p>

    <p>The second piece of Valve kit that's worth considering this Summer Sale is a Steam Link. It lets you easily
      stream your PC to any other display in your house and it does a pretty good job of it. Some games work better
      than others and you'll want a decent network connection to make it happen, but at just &#8362; 51 (70% percent off)
      it's a steal. </p>

    <p>You can even pick it up with a Steam Controller for &#8362; 154. </p>

    <p>To top it all off, the HTC Vive virtual reality headset also has a special bundle during the sale. For &#8362;
      2570, you can grab the headset and all of its accessories along with a free copy of Star Trek: Bridge Crew -
      which is a &#8362; 171 title in its own right. More than that, you also get a &#8362; 171 Steam Wallet card too, so you
      get &#8362; 2912 worth of stuff, for &#8362; 2570. Not bad for a piece of high-end future technology. </p>
