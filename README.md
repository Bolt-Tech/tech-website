# Tech-Website

## The First Project High-Tech Blog

Explore my first simple website that has been created from scratch using ```HTML```, ```SCSS/CSS``` and ```JavaScript```.
It is responsive with smartphone and tablet. It may not look perfect, but I did my best to make a web design adaptable for small screens.
It's been created in first and second semesters at college with excellent score.

## Prerequisites

* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (Compatible with Windows / Mac or Linux) and **must install two extensions:**
  * **[Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)** | To host online
  * **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** | To generate all ```CSS``` from ```SCSS``` in ```Styles Folder```

**Note:** My personal preference is Visual Studio Code, I'm sure there are other text editors with equivalent extensions/plugins that can be used with this project.

## Opening Bolt-Tech Website
To be able to see a live website, follow these steps:

1. When you open Visual Studio Code, click ```File``` on top left corner and click ```Open Folder...``` then navigate to your desired location where you cloned ```Tech-Website``` folder. **Or simply** right click on ```Tech-Website``` folder and click ```Open with Code```.

1. Then click ```Watch Sass``` on bottom right to begin generating all ```CSS```

1. Finally, on **Explorer** tab, right click on ```index.html``` then ```Open with Live Server```. That's it, enjoy my project website.
